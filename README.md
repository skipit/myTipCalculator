# myTipCalculator

This is the pre-Work required for CodePath iOS-Bootcamp. 

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: Initial Application based on the video walkthrough
 * [x] Optional: Addition of Settings Page. Supports persistence of the Default Tip Percentage. Used a UIPickerView to select the default tip percentage.  The TipPercentageSegment also selects the proper segment based on the default. 
 * [x] Optional: The previous Bill Amount is persisted and loaded in the text, if the application is relaunced within 10minutes.
 * [x] Optional: Use Current Locale to display the tipAmount and totalAmount.
 
Notes:
 * Spent some time with the autogenerated storyboard. Then had to undo it. 
 * Spent some time debugging rotation issues. And learning the layout constraints, to it supports rotation.
